For my creative tilt I wanted to allow the user to jump and slide to dodge obstacles not just move around, however I started working on this before we fully covered state machines, hence why I used a plethera of if statements and booleans and I now realize how redudent that was. I also tried to go for a scocer theme, since I love the sport, but it was really hard to find good assets and I had to buy the player sprites however I do love the way it turned out and am very glad.
